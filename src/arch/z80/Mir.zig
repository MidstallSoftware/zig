//! Machine Intermediate Representation.
//! This data is produced by Z80 codegen or Z80 assembler parsing
//! These instructions have a 1:1 correspondence with machine code instructions
//! for the target. MIR can be lowered to source-annotated textual assembly code
//! instructions, or it can be lowered to machine code.
//! The main purpose of MIR is to postpone the assignment of offsets until Isel,
//! so that, for example, the smaller encodings of jump instructions can be used.
